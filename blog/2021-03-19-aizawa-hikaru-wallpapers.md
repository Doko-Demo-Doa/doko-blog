![Aizawa Hikaru wallpaper collection](/img/aizawa_hikaru_thumb.jpg)

Took you long enough?

J/K.

For years I have been collecting wallpapers, not occasionally though. And [Aizawa Hikaru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_Aizawa) collection is one of my favorites.

Aizawa Hikaru is one of Microsoft's official mascots. She is the representative of (now-deprecated) Silverlight and Azure in Taiwan and Singapore.

You can preview and download them [here](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/9c2dlgrdxl45x/Aizawa_Hikaru). I don't think I missed anything, but if I do, feel free to [contact me](/portfolio).
