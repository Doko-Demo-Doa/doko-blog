Recently I got back into Yu-Gi-Oh, a popular card game that I used to play when I was a teenager. Synchron is one of my favorite decks, along with _Cyber Dragon_ and _Madolche_.

This post is where I note down my regular combo with Synchron deck (after Dawn of Majesty booster pack).

## Requirements

After the release of Dawn of Majesty pack, Synchron is now a very consistent deck with many ways to start. For example:

- Maxx C + Junk Synchron (yes, you can use Maxx C as starter)
- Synchron Carrier + Junk Synchron: Summon Synchron Carrier, then Junk Synchron
- Junk Converter + 1 tuner: so that you can discard Junk Converter along with it to add Junk Synchron
- Reinforcement of the Army + 1 level 2 monster
- Reinforcement of the Army + Junk Synchron
- Any level 2 non-tuner monster (warrior preferred) + Synchro Overtake

## The combo

If you have prepared those requirements, let's get into action. Assuming you have Synchron Carrier and Junk Synchron in your hand:

- Normal Summon Synchron Carrier
- Normal Summon Junk Synchron (thanks to Synchron Carrier's effect)
- Synchro Summon Junk Speeder
- Activate Junk Speeder's effect, Special Summon: Jet Synchron, Satellite Synchron, Junk Synchron, Stardust Synchron and Quickdraw Synchron.
- Activate Stardust Synchron's effect, add "Arrive in Light" into hand.
- Synchro Summon Gaiarmor Dragonshell using Jet Synchron and Junk Speeder (Level 1 + Level 5). Do not activate Jet Synchron's effect in GY.
- Activate "Arrive in Light", target "Converging Wills Dragon". It's now on the top of your deck.
- Synchro Summon Stardust Dragon using Satellite Synchron and Gaiarmor Dragonshell (Level 2 + Level 6)
- Activate "Arrive in Light"'s effect. Choose "Draw 1 card"
- Converging Wills Dragon drawn, activate its effect, Special Summon it from your hand.
- Activate Converging Wills Dragon's effect, Special Summon Omni Dragon Brotaur
- Activate Omni Dragon Brotaur's effect, target Junk Synchron, discard 1 card, add Doppel Warrior into hand (if you already have Doppel Warrior, you can skip this step)
- Synchro Summon T.G Hyper Librarian using Stardust Synchron and Omni Dragon Brotaur (Level 4 + Level 1)
- Activate Stardust Synchron's effect in GY. Tribute Quickdraw Synchron, Special Summon it from GY.
- Doppel Warrior's effect is now triggered. Special Summon it from hand. Your field should now have: Stardust Dragon, Converging Wills Dragon, T.G Hyper Librarian, Junk Synchron, Stardust Synchron, Doppel Warrior.
- Synchro Summon Shooting Majestic Star Dragon using Converging Wills Dragon, Stardust Dragon and Doppel Warrior, into _Extra Monster Zone_.
- T.G Hyper Librarian and Doppel Warrior's effect triggered, summon 2 tokens and draw 1 card.
- Synchro Summon Garden Rose Maiden using Stardust Synchron and 1 token (Level 4 + Level 1).
- Activate Librarian's effect and Maiden's effect. Draw 1 card and add Black Garden into hand.
- Activate Jet Synchron's effect in GY, discard 1 card (except Black Garden). Special Summon it from GY.
- Activate Black Garden.
- Synchro Summon Celestial Double Star Shaman using Jet Synchron and 1 token.
- Now it's a chain 3: Black Garden, Librarian and Shaman. Special Summon Doppel Warrior from GY. Special summon a token to opponent's field, then draw 1 card. Again, special summon a token to opponent's field. There should be 2 Rose Tokens now.
- Synchro Summon Cosmic Blazar Dragon using Garden Rose Maiden, T.G Hyper Librarian and Celestial Double Star Shaman.
- Cosmic Blazar Dragon's ATK is halved, don't worry as it can restore ATK easily. Don't activate Arrive in Light's Special Summon effect.
- Activate Black Garden's effect, destroy all tokens and Special Summon T.G Hyper Librarian from GY.
- Synchro Summon Accel Synchron using Junk Synchron and Doppel Warrior (Level 3 + Level 2).
- Activate Accel Synchron's effect. Send Stardust Synchron from the deck to GY and **reduce** its level to 1.
- Synchro Summon Martial Metal Marcher. Activate its effect (also T.G Librarian's effect) to Special Summon a level 2 tuner from GY (either Shaman or Satellite Synchron)
- Activate Garden Rose Maiden's effect in GY. Special Summon Stardust Dragon from GY.
- Now you can Synchro Summon Baronne de Fleur and Psy-Framelord Omega (or Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon). Personally I prefer Psy-Framelord Omega to get back banished cards. Make sure to Synchro Summon Baronne first to make use of Librarian's draw effect.
- The end field should have 4 synchro monsters (3 omni-negates, 1 disruption or 1 monster negate). The deck should have roughly 24-26 cards left.
