I'm a self-taught Golang, JavaScript and Rust developer with 6 years of experience. Focusing on cross-platform solutions and libraries, tips and hardware hacking. This website is for just anything of mine that I want to share, mostly about gaming, programming and regex references, as well as some halfway objectives that may never get done.

So far, I worked for 2-3 companies, mostly at web and mobile development. Now I'm working at Rens Original and maintaining their eCommerce system.
